# DeepLearning PJ1: MNIST Classification with Numpy

## 1. Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of a CNN model for MNIST classification using NumPy. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated on the test set. 

## 2. Requirements

- Python 3.7
- NumPy
- Cupy
- Matplotlib


## 3. Usage

To run the project, simply execute the `train.py` script. The script will train the CNN or MLP model. The training process will be visualized using Matplotlib.

## 4. Results

The project achieves an accuracy of 90.04% on the test set. The training process is visualized using Matplotlib, showing the training and validation loss and accuracy over time.
